# Web-Design-Challenge

## Background
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively.Data is more powerful when we share it with others!I have created a web dashboard to visulize the data to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

I created this website by plotting weather data, and the original GitHub respository found here python-api-challenge.

### Website Contents
The website consist of 7 pages total, including:

#### 1. Landing page
Containing an explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image will take to that visualization.

#### 2. Four visualization pages
With a descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

#### 3. Comparisons page
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
I used a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
The grid has two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

#### 4. Data page
In the data page I displayed a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
The table is constructed by using a bootstrap table component.
The data come from exporting the .csv file as HTML.
